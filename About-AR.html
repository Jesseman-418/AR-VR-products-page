        <h2>What is augmented reality (AR)?</h2>
        <p>
          Augmented reality (AR) is the integration of digital information with
          the user's environment in real time. Unlike virtual reality (VR),
          which creates a totally artificial environment, AR users experience a
          real-world environment with generated perceptual information overlaid
          on top of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          AR has a variety of uses, from assisting in the decision-making
          process to entertainment. It is used to either visually change natural
          environments in some way or to provide additional information to
          users. The primary benefit of AR is that it manages to blend digital
          and three-dimensional (3D) components with an individual's perception
          of the real world.
        </p>
        <p>
          AR delivers visual elements, sound, and other sensory information to
          the user through a device like a smartphone, glasses, or a headset.
          This information is overlaid onto the device to create an interwoven
          and immersive experience where digital information alters the user's
          perception of the physical world.

        <h2>How does augmented reality work?</h2>
        <p>
          Augmented reality is deliverable in a variety of formats, including
          within smartphones, glasses, and headsets. AR contact lenses are also
          in development. The technology requires hardware components, such as a
          processor, sensors, a display, and input devices. Mobile devices, like
          smartphones and tablets, already have this hardware onboard, making AR
          more accessible to the everyday user.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sophisticated AR programs might also include machine vision, object
          recognition, and gesture recognition. AR apps work using either
          marker-based or markerless methods. Marker-based AR applications are
          written in special 3D programs that let developers tie animation or
          contextual digital information into the computer program to an
          augmented reality marker in the real world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Markerless AR is more complex. The AR device doesn't focus on a
          specific point, so the device must recognize items as they appear in
          view. This type of AR requires a recognition algorithm that detects
          nearby objects and determines what they are.

        <h2>Top AR use cases</h2>
        <p>AR can be used in various industries and applications:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Retail: Consumers can use a store's online app to see how products,
            such as furniture, will look in their own homes before buying.
          </li>
          <li>
            Entertainment and gaming: AR can be used to overlay a video game in
            the real world or enable users to animate their faces in different
            and creative ways on social media.
          </li>
          <li>
            Navigation: Users can overlay a route to their destination over a
            live view of a road. AR used for navigation can also display
            information about local businesses in the user's immediate
            surroundings.
          </li>
          <li>
            Tools and measurement: Mobile devices can use AR to measure
            different 3D points in the user's environment.
          </li>
          <li>
            Art and architecture: AR can help artists visualize or work on a
            project.
          </li>
          <li>
            Military: Data can be displayed on a vehicle's windshield,
            indicating destination directions, distances, weather, and road
            conditions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Archaeology: AR aids archaeological research by helping
            archaeologists reconstruct sites. 3D models help museum visitors and
            future archaeologists experience an excavation site as if they were
            there.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Examples of AR</h2>
        <p>There are several examples of AR applications and devices:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Target app: The Target retail app feature See it in Your Space lets
            users take a photo of a space in their home and digitally view an
            object, such as a picture on the wall or a chair, to see how it will
            look there.
          </li>
          <li>
            Apple Measure app: The Measure app on Apple iOS acts like a tape
            measure by letting users select two or more points in their
            environment and measure the distance between them.
          </li>
          <li>
            Snapchat: Snapchat can overlay a filter or mask over the user's
            video or picture.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pokemon Go: Pokemon Go is a popular mobile AR game that uses the
            player's GPS sensors to detect where Pokemon creatures appear in the
            user's surrounding environment for them to catch.
          </li>
          <li>
            Google Glass: Google Glass was Google's first commercial attempt at
            a glasses-based AR system. This small wearable computer let users
            work hands-free.
          </li>
          <li>
            U.S. Army Tactical Augmented Reality (TAR): The U.S. Army uses AR in
            an eyepiece called TAR, which mounts onto the soldier's helmet and
            aids in locating another soldier's position.
